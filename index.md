### CPSC 120

*Lab 2

   Lab 2, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because as a kid I always used to get Madlib books because they were fun and interactive. Being able to create a program that simulates the same idea of filling in the blanks to create a short story was fascinating to me. In this lab I learned how to use std::cin to get input from the user and I also learned how to use string variables and how to print them.

*Lab 4

   Lab 4, part 4 was the Hi-Lo game, and this is one of my favorites because it was my first-time writing code for a game. In this lab, I learned how to use if and else statements to decide whether the program user figured out the secret number that was chosen at the beginning of the game. I also learned how to use the operators ==, >=, and <= along with the if and else statements to let the user know whether their guess was right or wrong.

*Lab 8

   Lab 8, part 1 was the sandwich ordering program. This lab was one of my favorites because I was able to create a program that can be used and applied in the business world. In this lab I learned how to use command line arguments to get input from the user on what they would like on their sandwich. Then by using a simple std::cout statement I was able to print out their order.
